    "In this assignment, we start with a sample of cancer data.  The sample data has 30 unknown features, and indicates whether each sample is malignant or benign.  We will create a neural network to identify the relevant features for determining malignancy, and apply the resulting network to predict cancer in a separate dataset.  "

    "I will create a neural network using the `sklearn.neural_network` module.  I will reserve a small subset (probably 15%) of the training data for testing purposes, and use the rest to train the neural network.  I will try several configurations of the network to identify the optimal settings, potentiall varying the number of hidden nodes, the activation function, and othe relevant parameters."

    "Since I do not have the actual results of the cancer samples used when applying the neural network, I cannot truly assess the accuracy of my classifier.  Additionally, the nature of a neural network makes the determinant factors in any given decision difficult to determine.  Even with the proper results, it could be difficult to determine the features that generated the results, whether correct or incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, the resulting distribution of diagnosis looks similar to that of the training data, which is encouraging, and the accuracy for the test data partition was cited at over 90%.  This suggests that the results are a reasonably accurate portrait of the actual diagnoses.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was surpised to find that, in spite of possessing 30 features, a hidden layer of size 10 generated the most accurate classifier.  I assumed that we would need a number of hidden layers comparable to the number of inputs before additional nodes became unnecessary.  I underestimated the efficacy of simpler configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I intended to try different activation functions, but time has thus far prohibited me from exploring this.  Nonetheless, the default rectified linear function seems to have provided a good balance of accuracy and performance."
